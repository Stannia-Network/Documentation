# ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¯ Translations

Not yet possible to translate plugins that aren't using our own translation library. If you need to translate other plugins, you can take a look at the paid resource [Triton](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/triton-translate-your-server.30331/).

Each plugin will register their language strings, with their default values in the API plugin. The API plugin will then save the default translation to the directory named `StanniaLibrary/locale/*/*.yml`.
