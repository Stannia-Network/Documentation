  Most of our libraries are kept open source and free to use entirely. We want
  to provide a good foundation for our own plugins as well as open for the
  possibility for others as well.

# Plugin Development

We mainly write everything using [Kotlin ](https://kotlinlang.org)and [Gradle](https://gradle.org). If you're a developer looking to use our libraries for your own plugins, it's highly recommended that you also write [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), not everything will be directly supported in Java.

If you insist on writing in Java, there are probably more compatible libraries for you to use.
