# Stannia

At the moment this site is under heavily development, and for that reason it's published, but with indexing off. So all you see in these pages is a work in progress.

### Who are we?

Currently there is only me ([Nozemi](https://github.com/Nozemi/)) running this show. I'm a passionate developer and tech enthusiast. I do Stannia mostly for fun, but who knows, maybe in the future it can become something more than just fun.

### Official Servers

_At this point in time, we do not yet have any official servers._

### Donations

_At this point in time, we do not accept any donations. In the future we might accept donations in form of cryptocurrency and/or_ [_Patreon_](https://www.patreon.com)_._
