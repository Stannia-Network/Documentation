# Stannia Plugins

Welcome to Stannia's documentation. We're planning to run official Stannia Minecraft servers eventually. However, before we can do that, we need a solid foundation to build custom functionality off of, which is why we're developing [Stannia's Plugin Library](developers/stannia-plugin-library/).

In the process we thought; why not contribute to the great community we have in Minecraft. We want to give back to the community that has given us a ton of their time, effort and genius ideas.

We mainly write everything using [Kotlin ](https://kotlinlang.org)and [Gradle](https://gradle.org). If you're a developer looking to use our libraries for your own plugins, it's highly recommended that you also write [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), although not impossible to use our libraries with Java-based plugins.
